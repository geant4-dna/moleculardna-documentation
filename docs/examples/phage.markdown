## Overview
The example simulates the irradiation of a DNA phage containing 141158 bp,
placed in a cylinder with radius 3.5 um and height 7 um.

## Geometry
Phage geometry is implemented in the provided macro file **phage.mac**. The file
*phage.txt* describes the atom positions in the geometry.

Radical kill distance and direct interaction range are set to 4 nm and 4 angstrom,
respectively.

```
# Geometry: size of World volume
/world/worldSize 9 um

# Geometry: creation
#  - Side length for each placement
/dnageom/placementSize 50 50 50 nm
#  - Scaling of XYZ in fractal definition file
/dnageom/fractalScaling 50 50 50 nm
#  - Path to file that defines placement locations
/dnageom/definitionFile geometries/phage.txt
#  - Set placement volumes
/dnageom/placementVolume turn geometries/1strand_50nm_turn.txt
/dnageom/placementVolume turntwist geometries/1strand_50nm_turn.txt true
/dnageom/placementVolume straight geometries/1strand_50nm_straight.txt

# Geometry: distance from base pairs at which radicals are killed
/dnageom/radicalKillDistance 4 nm

# Geometry: deposited energy accumulation range limit to start recording SBs from direct effects
/dnageom/interactionDirectRange 4.0 angstrom
```

The chromosome as region of interest for damage analysis is defined using:
```
/chromosome/add phage cyl 3500 7000 0 0 0 nm 0 0 0
```

## Particle source
A proton plane circular source is used, shooting a parallel beam.

```
# Source geometry
/gps/pos/type Plane
/gps/pos/shape Circle
/gps/pos/centre 0 7000 0 nm
/gps/pos/rot1 0 0 1
/gps/pos/rot2 1 0 0
/gps/pos/radius 3500 nm

# Source particle, energy and angular distribution
/gps/particle  proton
/gps/energy 2.5 MeV
/gps/direction 0 -1 0

# Beam on
/run/beamOn 10000
```

## Damage model
The following settings are used:
```
/dnadamage/directDamageLower 5 eV
/dnadamage/directDamageUpper 37.5 eV

/dnadamage/indirectOHBaseChance 1.0
/dnadamage/indirectOHStrandChance 0.405
/dnadamage/inductionOHChance 0.00

/dnadamage/indirectHBaseChance 1.0
/dnadamage/indirectHStrandChance 0.0
/dnadamage/inductionHChance 0.00

/dnadamage/indirectEaqBaseChance 1.0
/dnadamage/indirectEaqStrandChance 0.0
/dnadamage/inductionEaqChance 0.00

```

## Results
Output (see [analysis]({{"docs/overview/results-and-analysis"| relative_url}}))
is analysed by using the **phage.C** ROOT macro file.
